# Edge-Detection-FPGA

This project aims to develop an edge detection system using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The FPGA-based edge detection system will be designed to handle high-resolution images and operate at high speeds. The system will use popular edge detection algorithms such as Sobel, Canny, and Prewitt to detect edges in images. The project will also explore the feasibility of using different edge detection algorithms for various image processing applications.
